Question 1--

I created a function for a dachshund sprite using a variety of ellipses, arcs, and lines (all body parts and features are labeled), adding variables to 
translate and scale it. I then created the background, keeping the blue sky and adding a green rectangle for the grass. I created a function for a doghouse
to add to the background using rectangles, a triangles, and lines. I also used the text function for the first time to add a sign to the doghouse.
