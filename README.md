### Question 1--

I created a function for a dachshund sprite using a variety of ellipses, arcs, and lines (all body parts and features are labeled), adding variables to 
translate and scale it. I then created the background, keeping the blue sky and adding a green rectangle for the grass. I created a function for a doghouse
to add to the background using rectangles, a triangles, and lines. I also used the text function for the first time to add a sign to the doghouse.

### Question 2--

For question 2 we were tasked to add a conditional statement to our catcher function to change the appearance of the catcher when the mouse is pressed. I added a conditional so that when the mouse is pressed the sprite gets larger. I also had to add a translate so that when the sprite gets larger it doesn't look like it's moving.  

``` javascript
  if (mouseIsPressed) {
    scale(1.05);
    translate(0, -5);
  }
```
